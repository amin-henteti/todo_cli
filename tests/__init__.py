"""
adding an __init__.py file is useful for several reasons:

- It signals to Python that the directory is a package 
  and enables importing of modules from the directory.
- It allows initialization code to be run when the package is imported, 
  such as setting up fixtures or running setup code for the tests.
- It can be used to control the visibility of objects and functions in the package, 
  by specifying what should be imported when the package is imported.
  
Overall, adding an __init__.py file to a test directory is a good practice 
as it makes the test suite more organized and easier to work with.
